# Title
Comparing racial and gender disparities in police stops in blue and red states

# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, datasets used. What's the motivation behind your project? How do you propose to extend the analysis from the paper? What story would you like to tell, and why? 
We want to see if there is a correlation between the states' major political party (Republican or Democrat) and the race and sex of the drivers. We will use a new dataset: the electoral map of the 2016 Presidential election, indicating the winning color of the state (blue for Democrat and red for Republican). In these two types of states, we will extract the race and sex of stopped drivers, as well as whether a search was conducted and if contraband was found to determine the hit rate. We will analyze the hit rate based on the race and sex drivers independently, in at least one state per major political party. We would like to perform this analysis to determine whether one's political party can affect racial and gender bias.

# Research Questions
In our project we would like to find out whether there is a correlation between racial bias and political orientation, by comparing the hit rates in blue and red states. 
We also wonder whether there is a bias according to other characteristics of the driver and would like to extend our study to the gender of the driver. We will perform a hit rates comparison according to the gender, and compare the results of the blue and red states - as we did before with the race. We will try to conclude by saying whether there are disparities according to the major political orientation of the state and on which criteria.
To summarize in research questions :
- Is the racial bias correlated to the major political party ?
- Is there a gender based bias in police stops ?
- If there is, is it correlated to the major political party ?

# Proposed dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you've read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible given the datasets at hand.
  1. The electoral map of the 2016 presidential election. We will pick at least one state per major political party based on the criteria "places that tend to       vote much more democratic" or "places that tend to vote much more republican". For now, we plan to choose Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode Island and/or New Jersey for blue, and Texas, South Carolina and/or Montana for red.
  2. The dataset from the article. We will extract the race, sex, search conducted and contraband found criteria. For each state, we will use the State Patrol data.

# Methods
Our approach will consist of: 
  - creating adapted datasets by including the gender of the driver and choosing blue and red states for which this information and the ones needed for the hit rates are available,
  - once the replication of figure 3 is done: adapt it to our project by allowing our function to compare hit rates according to gender instead of race, and allowing it to compare two datasets from two different states,
  - present the data obtained in a clear way for different states and different characteristics, and find a metric that allows us to compare them,
  - try to draw conclusions

# Proposed timeline
  1. By December 4th: extract and process all the data for analysis
  2. By December 8th: finished part B and adapt it to the project (hit rate)
  3. By December 11th: finished all the figures
  4. By December 15th: finished results discussion + start video
  5. December 18th: finish video + Project Milestone P4 due

# Organization within the team
Referring to the timeline above:
  1. 1st milestone: Louis and Margaux
  2. 2nd milestone: Hannah and Margaux. Everyone worked on part B.
  3. 3rd milestone: Louis and Hannah
  4. 4th milestone: everyone worked on discussion.
  5. we finish the report and the video together.

# Questions for TAs (optional)
Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.
  1. Is our analysis specific enough? 
  2. Should we just focus on just one of racial bias or gender bias and not both?
  3. Is our timeline realistic?
  4. Do you think that using data from just one state per party is enough, or should we use 2 or 3?
